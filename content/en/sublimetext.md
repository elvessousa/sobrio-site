## About this theme

Currently, Sobrio does not have a UI theme, but the `Adaptive` theme is good enough.

## Installation

As of now, this theme is not available for installation in Package Control. So the process can feel a bit manual. To install it, follow these four simple steps:

1. Select `Browse Packages` in the `Preferences` menu.
2. Download the file [Sobrio.sublime-color-scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elvessousa/sobrio-sublime/master/Sobrio.sublime-color-scheme) or [Sobrio Light.sublime-color-scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elvessousa/sobrio-sublime/master/Sobrio%20Light.sublime-color-scheme) and put it into the `/Users` folder inside the folder opened in the previous step.
3. Go to `Preferences > Select Color Scheme` and set the color scheme to `Sobrio` or `Sobrio Light` in the **Color Scheme** popup.
4. Profit!
