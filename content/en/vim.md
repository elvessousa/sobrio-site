This is a theme for **Vim**, with sober colors (at least for me), hence the name.
It has support for italic fonts, too. The font used in the screenshots is Victor Mono. At the moment, I only tested it in Neovim, but I think it should work with Vim as well. For the best experience, make sure your terminal supports at least 256 colors.

## Installation

To use it, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `colors/sobrio.vim` file to your VIM colors directory, usually `~/.vim/colors/`
2. Set the color scheme: `:colorscheme sobrio`.
3. ???
4. Profit!

## Setting it as your default

If you want to make it your default, just add this line to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
colorscheme sobrio
```
